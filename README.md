My first cloned app using HTML CSS and JS.

Contains 3 main folders HTML CSS and JS

Each folder contains 2 subfiles for the index and the feed pages.

The index page is the login page built with HTML and CSS and authenticated with JS.

The feed page comes after signing into the app.

Main challenge faced was with the top and left navbars. Got the top navbar to work at first and tried adding some other elements and it just distorted everything. Tried tweaking it as much as i could.

Concerning the left navbar was difficult to get the labels of the logos to be aligned properly since was using logos instead of images. Tried aligning it with grid but didnt get the required results.

Resource materials inlcude Google Chrome, VS code, HTML, CSS, JS, Youtube, Freecodecamp, Gemini.
